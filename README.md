# Localization of a robot using Kalman filters

We are trying to localize a robot in a map which has 6 beacons.


How to run:
- Run  the main.py
- Control the robot using the keys W, S, L, R, and X

Commands:
- W: Increase the robot velocity
- S: Decrease the robot velocity
- L: Turn left
- R: Turn right
- X: Stop the robot

When done with the simulation, you can stop it using "P".
A RMSE graph will be plotted showing the difference between the actual position and the predicted one during the simulation.
